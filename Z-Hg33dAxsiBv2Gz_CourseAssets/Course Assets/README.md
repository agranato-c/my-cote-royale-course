# Cote Royale Course Assets

These are the assets for the Animated Luxury Website course on the Prismic YouTube channel.

## Setup Steps

- Place the files in the `Local Files` folder in your Next.js project's `public` folder.
- Place the files in the `Prismic Files` folder in your Prismic Media Library.
- Use the `Slice Snapshots` in Slice Machine to give each slice a preview image.
- Place `icon.svg` in your project's `/app/` directory. Delete the old favicon and Next.js will automatically set the new one as the favicon.
- Download the font [Gambarino](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/gambarino) from Fontshare. Copy the file `/Fonts/WEB/fonts/Gambarino-regular.woff2` into your project's `/app/` directory.
